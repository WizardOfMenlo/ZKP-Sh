  abstract = {Usually, a proof of a theorem contains more knowledge than the mere fact that the theorem is true. For instance, to prove that a graph is Hamiltonian it suffices to exhibit a Hamiltonian tour in it; however, this seems to contain more knowledge than the single bit Hamiltonian/non-Hamiltonian.In this paper a computational complexity theory of the ``knowledge'' contained in a proof is developed. Zero-knowledge proofs are defined as those proofs that convey no additional knowledge other than the correctness of the proposition in question. Examples of zero-knowledge proof systems are given for the languages of quadratic residuosity and 'quadratic nonresiduosity. These are the first examples of zero-knowledge proofs for languages not known to be efficiently recognizable.},

  title = {A Personal View of Average-Case Complexity},
  abstract = {The structural theory of average-case complexity, introduced by Levin (1986), gives a formal setting for discussing the types of inputs for which a problem is difficult. This is vital to understanding both when a seemingly difficult (e.g. NP-complete) problem is actually easy on almost all instances, and to determining which problems might be suitable for applications requiring hard problems, such as cryptography. The paper attempts to summarize the state of knowledge in this area, including some "folklore" results that have not explicitly appeared in print. We also try to standardize and unify definitions. Finally, we indicate what we feel are interesting research directions. We hope that the paper motivates more research in this area and provide an introduction to the area for people new to it.},

  abstract = {In this paper the generality and wide applicability of Zero-knowledge proofs, a notion introduced by Goldwasser, Micali, and Rackoff is demonstrated. These are probabilistic and interactive proofs that, for the members of a language, efficiently demonstrate membership in the language without conveying any additional knowledge. All previously known zero-knowledge proofs were only for number-theoretic languages in NP fl CONP. Under the assumption that secure encryption functions exist or by using ``physical means for hiding information, `` it is shown that all languages in NP have zero-knowledge proofs. Loosely speaking, it is possible to demonstrate that a CNF formula is satisfiable without revealing any other property of the formula, in particular, without yielding neither a satis@ing assignment nor properties such as whether there is a satisfying assignment in which xl = X3 etc. It is also demonstrated that zero-knowledge proofs exist ``outside the domain of cryptography and number theory. '' Using no assumptions. it is shown that both graph isomorphism and graph nonisomorphism have zero-knowledge interactive proofs. The mere existence of an interactive proof for graph nonisomorphism is interesting, since graph nonisomorphism is not known to be in NP and hence no efficient proofs were known before for demonstrating that two graphs are not isomorphic.},

@article{moraisSurveyZeroKnowledge2019,
  title = {A Survey on Zero Knowledge Range Proofs and Applications},
  volume = {1},
  issn = {2523-3971},
  abstract = {In last years, there has been an increasing effort to leverage distributed ledger technology (DLT), including blockchain. One of the main topics of interest, given its importance, is the research and development of privacy mechanisms, as for example is the case of zero knowledge proofs (ZKP). ZKP is a cryptographic technique that can be used to hide information that is put into the ledger, while still allowing to perform validation of this data. In this work we describe different strategies to construct zero knowledge range proofs (ZKRP), as for example the scheme proposed by Boudot (in: Bart (ed) Advances in cryptology\textemdash{}EUROCRYPT 2000, Springer, Berlin, 2000) in 2001; the one proposed by Camenisch et al. (in: Josef (ed) Advances in cryptology\textemdash{}ASIACRYPT 2008, Springer, Berlin, 2008), and bulletproofs (B{\"u}nz et al., in: 2018 IEEE symposium on security and privacy (SP), 2018), proposed in 2017. We also compare these strategies and discuss possible use cases. Since bulletproofs (B{\"u}nz et al. 2018) is the most efficient construction, we will give a detailed description of its algorithms and optimizations. Bulletproofs is not only more efficient than previous schemes, but also avoids the trusted setup, which is a requirement that is not desirable in the context of DLT and blockchain. In case of cryptocurrencies, if the setup phase is compromised, it would be possible to generate money out of thin air. Interestingly, bulletproofs can also be used to construct generic ZKP, in the sense that it can be used to prove generic statements, and thus it is not only restricted to ZKRP, but it can be used for any kind of proof of knowledge. Hence Bulletproofs leads to a more powerful tool to provide privacy for DLT. Here we describe in detail the algorithms involved in Bulletproofs protocol for ZKRP. Also, we present our implementation, which was open sourced (Morais et al., in: Zero knowledge range proof implementation, 2018. https://github.com/ing-bank/zkrangeproof).},
