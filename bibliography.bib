For example, using a threshold scheme, the prover can show that he knows at least d out of n solutions without revealing which d instances are involved. If the instances are independently generated, we get a witness hiding protocol, even if PP \textbackslash{}mathcal\{P\} did not have this property. Our results can be used to efficiently implement general forms of group oriented identification and signatures. Our transformation produces a protocol with the same number of rounds as PP \textbackslash{}mathcal\{P\} and communication complexity n times that of PP \textbackslash{}mathcal\{P\} . Our results use no unproven complexity assumptions.},

All previously known zero-knowledge proofs were only for number-theoretic languages in NP fl CONP. Under the assumption that secure encryption functions exist or by using ``physical means for hiding information, `` it is shown that all languages in NP have zero-knowledge proofs. Loosely speaking, it is possible to demonstrate that a CNF formula is satisfiable without revealing any other property of the formula, in particular, without yielding neither a satis@ing assignment nor properties such as whether there is a satisfying assignment in which xl = X3 etc. It is also demonstrated that zero-knowledge proofs exist ``outside the domain of cryptography and number theory. '' Using no assumptions. it is shown that both graph isomorphism and graph nonisomorphism have zero-knowledge interactive proofs. The mere existence of an interactive proof for graph nonisomorphism is interesting, since graph nonisomorphism is not known to be in NP and hence no efficient proofs were known before for demonstrating that two graphs are not isomorphic.},

This problem is NP-complete, and the difficulty of solving it is the basis of public-key cryptosystems of knapsack type. An algorithm is proposed that searches for a solution when given an instance of the subset sum problem. This algorithm always halts in polynomial time but does not always find a solution when one exists. It converts the problem to one of finding a particular short vector v in a lattice, and then uses a lattice basis reduction algorithm due to A. K. Lenstra, H. W. Lenstra, Jr., and L. Lovasz to attempt to find v. The performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed. Let the density d of a subset sum problem be defined by d = n/log2(maxi ai). Then for ``almost all'' problems of density d {$<$} 0.645, the vector v we searched for is the shortest nonzero vector in the lattice. For ``almost all'' problems of density d {$<$} 1/n, it is proved that the lattice basis reduction algorithm locates v. Extensive computational tests of the algorithm suggest that it works for densities d {$<$} dc(n), where dc(n) is a cutoff value that is substantially larger than 1/n. This method gives a polynomial time attack on knapsack public-key cryptosystems that can be expected to break them if they transmit information at rates below dc(n), as n \textrightarrow{} {$\infty$}.},

In this paper we propose a scheme that distributes secret shares of the factorization of an integer to multi-parties without their participation in the protocols for share distribution and verification. A single verifier suffices to verify the correctness of the shares using the public keys of the off-line shareholders. Due to the universal verifiability, a guaranteed correctness of secret sharing is achieved without relying on the honesty of the verifier.},

One of the main topics of interest, given its importance, is the research and development of privacy mechanisms, as for example is the case of zero knowledge proofs (ZKP). ZKP is a cryptographic technique that can be used to hide information that is put into the ledger, while still allowing to perform validation of this data. In this work we describe different strategies to construct zero knowledge range proofs (ZKRP), as for example the scheme proposed by Boudot (in: Bart (ed) Advances in cryptology\textemdash{}EUROCRYPT 2000, Springer, Berlin, 2000) in 2001; the one proposed by Camenisch et al. (in: Josef (ed) Advances in cryptology\textemdash{}ASIACRYPT 2008, Springer, Berlin, 2008), and bulletproofs (B{\"u}nz et al., in: 2018 IEEE symposium on security and privacy (SP), 2018), proposed in 2017. We also compare these strategies and discuss possible use cases. Since bulletproofs (B{\"u}nz et al. 2018) is the most efficient construction, we will give a detailed description of its algorithms and optimizations. Bulletproofs is not only more efficient than previous schemes, but also avoids the trusted setup, which is a requirement that is not desirable in the context of DLT and blockchain. In case of cryptocurrencies, if the setup phase is compromised, it would be possible to generate money out of thin air. Interestingly, bulletproofs can also be used to construct generic ZKP, in the sense that it can be used to prove generic statements, and thus it is not only restricted to ZKRP, but it can be used for any kind of proof of knowledge. Hence Bulletproofs leads to a more powerful tool to provide privacy for DLT. Here we describe in detail the algorithms involved in Bulletproofs protocol for ZKRP. Also, we present our implementation, which was open sourced (Morais et al., in: Zero knowledge range proof implementation, 2018. https://github.com/ing-bank/zkrangeproof).},

One of them is in fact equivalent to the Nostradamus attack by Kelsey and Kohno (Eurocrypt 2006), and, when considering keyed compression functions, both are closely related to the ePre and eSec notions by Rogaway and Shrimpton (FSE 2004).},

In this way we improve the ElGamal signature scheme in the speed of the procedures for the generation and the verification of signatures and also in the bit length of signatures.

The new protocol resists dictionary attacks mounted by either passive or active network intruders, allowing, in principle, even weak passphrases to be used safely. It also offers perfect forward secrecy, which protects past sessions and passwords against future compromises. Finally, user passwords are stored in a form that is not plaintext-equivalent to the password itself, so an attacker who captures the password database cannot use it directly to compromise security and gain immediate access to the host. This new protocol combines techniques of zero-knowledge proofs with asymmetric key exchange protocols and offers significantly improved performance over comparably strong extended methods that resist stolen-verifier attacks such as Augmented EKE or B-SPEKE. 1 Introduction Password authentication protocols come in many flavors, b...},
