She therefore needs a tool for proving that a committed number lies in a specific interval. Up to now, such tools were either inefficient (too many bits to compute and to transmit) or inexact (i.e. proved membership to a much larger interval). This paper presents a new proof, which is both efficient and exact. Here, ``efficient'' means that there are less than 20 exponentiations to perform and less than 2 Kbytes to transmit. The potential areas of application of this proof are numerous (electronic cash, group signatures, publicly verifiable secret encryption, etc ...).},

The hardness of SSP varies greatly with the density of the problem. In particular, when m, the logarithm of the largest input number, is at least c {$\cdot$} n for some constant c, the problem can be solved by a reduction to finding a short vector in a lattice. On the other hand, when m = O(log n) the problem can be solved in polynomial time using dynamic programming or some other algorithms especially designed for dense instances. However, as far as we are aware, all known algorithms for dense SSP take at least {$\Omega$}(2m) time, and no polynomial time algorithm is known which solves SSP when m = {$\omega$}(log n) (and m = o(n)).},

Under the assumption that secure encryption functions exist or by using ``physical means for hiding information, `` it is shown that all languages in NP have zero-knowledge proofs. Loosely speaking, it is possible to demonstrate that a CNF formula is satisfiable without revealing any other property of the formula, in particular, without yielding neither a satis@ing assignment nor properties such as whether there is a satisfying assignment in which xl = X3 etc. It is also demonstrated that zero-knowledge proofs exist ``outside the domain of cryptography and number theory.

The mere existence of an interactive proof for graph nonisomorphism is interesting, since graph nonisomorphism is not known to be in NP and hence no efficient proofs were known before for demonstrating that two graphs are not isomorphic.},

The paper attempts to summarize the state of knowledge in this area, including some "folklore" results that have not explicitly appeared in print. We also try to standardize and unify definitions. Finally, we indicate what we feel are interesting research directions. We hope that the paper motivates more research in this area and provide an introduction to the area for people new to it.},

In this paper we propose a scheme that distributes secret shares of the factorization of an integer to multi-parties without their participation in the protocols for share distribution and verification. A single verifier suffices to verify the correctness of the shares using the public keys of the off-line shareholders. Due to the universal verifiability, a guaranteed correctness of secret sharing is achieved without relying on the honesty of the verifier.},

  abstract = {In last years, there has been an increasing effort to leverage distributed ledger technology (DLT), including blockchain. One of the main topics of interest, given its importance, is the research and development of privacy mechanisms, as for example is the case of zero knowledge proofs (ZKP). ZKP is a cryptographic technique that can be used to hide information that is put into the ledger, while still allowing to perform validation of this data. In this work we describe different strategies to construct zero knowledge range proofs (ZKRP), as for example the scheme proposed by Boudot (in: Bart (ed) Advances in cryptology\textemdash{}EUROCRYPT 2000, Springer, Berlin, 2000) in 2001; the one proposed by Camenisch et al. (in: Josef (ed) Advances in cryptology\textemdash{}ASIACRYPT 2008, Springer, Berlin, 2008), and bulletproofs (B{\"u}nz et al., in: 2018 IEEE symposium on security and privacy (SP), 2018), proposed in 2017. We also compare these strategies and discuss possible use cases. Since bulletproofs (B{\"u}nz et al. 2018) is the most efficient construction, we will give a detailed description of its algorithms and optimizations. Bulletproofs is not only more efficient than previous schemes, but also avoids the trusted setup, which is a requirement that is not desirable in the context of DLT and blockchain. In case of cryptocurrencies, if the setup phase is compromised, it would be possible to generate money out of thin air. Interestingly, bulletproofs can also be used to construct generic ZKP, in the sense that it can be used to prove generic statements, and thus it is not only restricted to ZKRP, but it can be used for any kind of proof of knowledge. Hence Bulletproofs leads to a more powerful tool to provide privacy for DLT. Here we describe in detail the algorithms involved in Bulletproofs protocol for ZKRP. Also, we present our implementation, which was open sourced (Morais et al., in: Zero knowledge range proof implementation, 2018. https://github.com/ing-bank/zkrangeproof).},

It also offers perfect forward secrecy, which protects past sessions and passwords against future compromises. Finally, user passwords are stored in a form that is not plaintext-equivalent to the password itself, so an attacker who captures the password database cannot use it directly to compromise security and gain immediate access to the host. This new protocol combines techniques of zero-knowledge proofs with asymmetric key exchange protocols and offers significantly improved performance over comparably strong extended methods that resist stolen-verifier attacks such as Augmented EKE or B-SPEKE. 1 Introduction Password authentication protocols come in many flavors, b...},
